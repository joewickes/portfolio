                        <h2>HI! I'M JOE</h2>
                        <p>I am an aspiring full-stack Web Developer in Tampa, Florida. Being full-stack means that I work with both 
                            the front-end (what you can see/interact with) as well as the back-end (servers, data, etc.). 
                            I build awesome websites and web apps.
                        </p>

                        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                        <p>
                            No other time in history has had such an interconnected world available at its fingertips. 
                            I think the web is incredible because it provides a platform in which people can imagine, build, 
                            and refine things together. In my opinion, there is no better place to do that from than as a 
                            full-stack Web Developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the internet is built on interconnectivity, it makes a lot of sense that the teams that 
                            work on it should do the same. I look forward to the chance to work with other developers so that 
                            we can bounce ideas off of one another. When one person gets stuck, someone else can step in to
                            help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of developing, I love to spend time with my family. I am also really into movies, coffee (ChemEx/pour over recently), 
                            video games, and spending time outdoors. Since I live in Tampa, I like to go to the beach when I 
                            can. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a full-stack Web Developer, which can mean one thing to one person, and a totally different 
                            thing to another. For me, being a full-stack web developer means that I can totally build a website 
                            or web app and manage/configure the back-end behind it.
                        </p>
